## Description
This is a web aplication that allows you to run an in browser text editor.

 -I built this project to practice building with React.

 -This problem addresses the need for a text editor if your preinstalled text editor app doesnt work on your machine.

 -I learned how to deploy Heroku, work with React, and running webpack plugins.
